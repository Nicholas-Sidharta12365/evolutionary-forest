### Resources
#### [Paper Reference](./An_Evolutionary_Forest_for_Regression.pdf)

## Description
An implementation of evolutionary forest using the AirQuality dataset found in the UCI repository. The evolutionary forest is a new type of ensemble method that uses genetic programming to evolve a forest of trees. The evolutionary forest is compared to a random forest. The evolutionary forest is found to be more accurate than the random forest model.
